# datathon-covid-project
## This project was created for the final project in the LaGuardia Community College Microcredential Datathon. I worked with a team of 3 to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on the New York State Unemployment rates and stock prices for companies producing the vaccine.

## Findings: 
### Cases were increasing in March, continued to increase until June. Most deaths were recorded in the first quarter of the pandemic. Most cases were recorded in late December. Deaths probably reduced because there is better technology and understanding of disease to control it.

### NY unemployment rates reached a peak in April and May. Since then, the unemployment rates have decreased, yet aren't as low as they were in January and February. The recovery may be associated with the slow  reopening of businesses.

### Stocks related to vaccine-producing companies were slowly increasing, until there was a big jump in November, especially with the Moderna and the BionTech stocks. BionTech produced the vaccine and investors were in favor of the stock to increase. Pfizer was leading in mass production and distribution.
